Fridges are made to contain spiny lobsters, and spiny lobsters help mathematicians who eat them and have hence better abilities to do mathematics, which are helpful for physics, which helps us make fridges which... ——Laurent Schwartz

> 振衣千仞岗，濯足万里流

> But still a large part of mathematics which became useful developed
with absolutely no desire to be useful, and in situations where nobody
could possibly know in what area it would become useful; and there
were no general indications that it ever would be so. By and large it is
uniformly true in mathematics that there is a time lapse between a
mathematical discovery and the moment when it is useful; and that this
lapse of time can be anything (rom thirty to a hundred years, in some
cases even more; and that the whole system seems to function without
any direction, without any reference to usefulness. . . This is true for
all of science. Successes were largely due to forgetting completely about
what one ultimately wanted, or whether one wanted anything ulti-
mately; in refusing to investigate things which profit, and in relying
solely on guidance by criteria of intellectual elegance; it was by follow-
ing this rule that one actually got ahead in the long run, much better
than any strictly utilitarian course would have permitted.

> Allez en avant, et la foi vous viendra

> Grothendieck comparing two approaches, with the metaphor of opening a nut: the hammer and chisel approach, striking repeatedly until the nut opens, or just letting the nut open naturally by immersing it in some soft liquid and let time pass:
"I can illustrate the second approach with the same image of a nut to be opened. The first analogy that came to my mind is of immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better, and otherwise you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible through weeks and months—when the time is ripe, hand pressure is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado! A different image came to me a few weeks ago. The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it... yet it finally surrounds the resistant substance."

> Fads are as common in mathematics as in any other human activity, and it is always difficult to separate the enduring from the ephemeral in the achievements of one’s own time. At present there is a strong current of abstraction flowing through our graduate schools of mathematics. This current has scoured away many of the individual features of the landscape and replaced them with the smooth, rounded boulders of general theories. When taken in moderation, these general theories are both useful and satisfying; but one unfortunate effect of their predominance is that if a student doesn’t learn a little while he is an undergraduate about such color- ful and worthwhile topics as the wave equation, Gauss’s hypergeometric function, the gamma function, and the basic problems of the calculus of variations—among many others—then he is unlikely to do so later. The natural place for an informal acquaintance with such ideas is a leisurely introductory course on differential equations. Some of our current books on this subject remind me of a sightseeing bus whose driver is so obsessed with speeding along to meet a schedule that his passengers have little or no opportunity to enjoy the scenery. Let us be late occasionally, and take greater pleasure in the journey. --George F.Simmons

> What is the use of these results? The answer is that I don’t know. They will almost certainly produce some theorems in the theory of partial differential equations, and some of them may find application in imaging with MRI or ultrasound, but that is by no means certain. It is also beside the point. Quinto and I are studying these topics because they are interesting in their own right as mathematical problems, and that is what science is all about.  ---Cormack
