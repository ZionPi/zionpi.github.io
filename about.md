> What are mathematics helpful for ? Mathematics are helpful for physics. Physics helps us make fridges. Fridges are made to contain spiny lobsters, and spiny lobsters help mathematicians who eat them and have hence better abilities to do mathematics, which are helpful for physics, which helps us make fridges which... ——Laurent Schwartz

> "A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power off and on. Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: "You cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what is going wrong." Knight turned the machine off and on. The machine worked."

> But still a large part of mathematics which became useful developed
with absolutely no desire to be useful, and in situations where nobody
could possibly know in what area it would become useful; and there
were no general indications that it ever would be so. By and large it is
uniformly true in mathematics that there is a time lapse between a
mathematical discovery and the moment when it is useful; and that this
lapse of time can be anything (rom thirty to a hundred years, in some
cases even more; and that the whole system seems to function without
any direction, without any reference to usefulness. . . This is true for
all of science. Successes were largely due to forgetting completely about
what one ultimately wanted, or whether one wanted anything ulti-
mately; in refusing to investigate things which profit, and in relying
solely on guidance by criteria of intellectual elegance; it was by follow-
ing this rule that one actually got ahead in the long run, much better
than any strictly utilitarian course would have permitted.
